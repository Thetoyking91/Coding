## Coding

Coding is what makes our computers work.
Without code our computers would just be nothing.

## Coding languages

There are a lot of different coding laungages (such as Python, Ruby, Java,
Javascript, JSON, HTML, Css, C#, C++, ect).

## Variables

Variables are strings used in most coding languages.
This is how you create a variable in python:

name = value

for example:

age = 9.

Then if you want to show a variable in python you can do:

print(name)

For example:

print(age)

The output would look like this:

9

## Terms

Coding has a lot of different terms.
Here are some examples:

A bug (a problem with code), source code (code that allows something to work), open source (the source code is publicly available) and a filetype (the type of file a file is).
